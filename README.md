Julia is learning French and is using the translator to help her translate words from English to French or vice versa. 
She uses the vocabulary feature where she can choose to store a certain word and its translation in a page called 
“Vocabulary”. She can access the page at any time allowing her to revise or recall the words to advance her learning 
process. The process is: Julia will click on the vocabulary page and manually input in both languages (view shown below)
