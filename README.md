Julia is learning French and is using the translator to help her translate words from English to French or vice versa.
She uses the vocabulary feature where she can choose to store a certain word and its translation in a page called
“Vocabulary”. She can access the page at any time allowing her to revise or recall the words to advance her learning
process. The process is: Julia will click on the vocabulary page and manually input in both languages (view shown below)

Christina is studying abroad in Japan and sees a sign at a subway. She is not very familiar with Japanese.
She is in a rush and cannot easily type in the characters into her translation app so she uses the convert image
to text feature to take a picture and translate the sign.

Edan is currently enrolled in a Korean learning course and several course materials are distributed in different
format of files. He wants those text in the files to be translated directly into his mother language so that he
does not have to copy and paste the text from the file into the translator. Therefore, he uses the
translate-file feature to translate the materials in an efficient way.

Karmen is working on a history assignment that requires translating a lengthy article from a foreign language.
To ensure she stays within the free-tier limits of the translation service, she needs to monitor the character count
and limit from the App. Using the "CheckUsage" feature, Karmen can track her usage, avoid exceeding the limit
and complete her assignment without unexpected costs.
