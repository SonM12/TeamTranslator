## 1. Summary of the project's purpose

## 2. Features of the Software

The Translator has mutlitple features which include:<br><br>

1. **Translate Text**

The translate text use case allows the user to translate text from one language to another.

<ins>Example user story:</ins>
Emily is learning Spanish for the first time. Her Spanish assingment requires her to write about her summer vacation.
However, Emily forgot how to say "beach" in Spanish. She uses The Translator to translate the word "beach" from English
to Spanish. The Translator gives her back "playa" which is the correct Spanish word for "beach".

<ins>Example use case tutorial:</ins>

2. **Switch Translation**

The switch translation use case allows the user to switch the input language to become the ouput language and
vice-versa. It also allows the user to switch the input text to become the ouput text and
vice-versa.

<ins>Example user story:</ins>
Julia is translating a sentence from English to her second language, French. She wants to make sure that the generated
translation is correct. She clicks the switch button and ends up with the translated French sentence as the input and
the English sentence she originally wrote as the output. She reads that English translation and sees that it makes
sense and does communicate the same point as what she had originally written (it could be the exact same thing she had
inputted but sometimes translators can alter the sentence). This helped her ensure that the French translation that was
generated by the program was indeed correct.

3. **Translate File**

The translate file use case allows the user to input a file and translate the text in the file into their chosen
language.

<ins>Example user story:</ins>
Edan is currently enrolled in a Korean learning course and several course materials are distributed in different
format of files. He wants those text in the files to be translated directly into his mother language so that he
does not have to copy and paste the text from the file into the translator. Therefore, he uses the
translate-file feature to translate the materials in an efficient way.

4. **Translate Image**

The translate image use case allows the user to input an image and translate the text in the image into their chosen
language.

<ins>Example user story:</ins>
Christina is studying abroad in Japan and sees a sign at a subway. She is not very familiar with Japanese and she 
cannot easily type in the characters into her translation app so she uses the convert image to text feature to take 
a picture and translate the sign.

he came across some words or sentences he does not know how to pronounce. Using the speaker button located at the 
bottom right side of text boxes, Roy can listen to the inputted pronounciation.
